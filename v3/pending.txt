  - new design (viti)
  - reimplement benchmarks

* reporting tool (new feature)

- Fetching language files asyncronously does not work for offline use (CORS is
  not compatible with file protocol, find alternative way to loading files
  offline.)

* Landing Page (TBD with VITI)
  - Design should be improved
  - Links don’t look appealing
  - Should include information about income
  - 'Help' button is not easy to find
  - Support docs are missing (esp. Spanish)

* General Info (TBD with VITI)
  - It should be obvious which data is relevant and why (Colours, symbol etc)

* Population (TBD with VITI)
  - Names of input fields could be clearer
  - It’s not clear that the definitions appear if you hover over the fields. A simple (?) could help
  - Definitions should be shorter and more concrete (see FSM, missing definitions)

* Configuration
  - Difference between Tier A and B is not clear
  - They are two different assessments, but it looks like you have to do both + the costs can only be inserted in Tier A. If in ECAM 3.0 both tiers are completely separated, costs should also be inserted in Tier B.

* Tier A:
  - There should be an explanatory sentence on what Tier A (and B), also highlighting the importance of data
  - Results of Tier A are confusing because there are shown as “Outputs” and not as assumed under “Summaries”.
  - Sankey Graphic is not easy to find, it should be under graphics /summary

* Tier B:
  - The tips in the top right corner get lost
  - Advance assessment is easily overseen (+)
  - Advance assessment is not clear. When should this be used and how? For example, it should be used if there are different treatment technologies

* Summaries page:
  - Difference between Tier A and B results should be clearer
  - Units of results could be more obvious
  - Results of sub-stages are only shown when the box is ticked. This is not clear

* Opportunities page:
  - It is not clear how to use it or how results are to be interpreted.
  - Spanish translations are needed
