                        ECAM V3 LLUIS BOSCH TASKS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              to be done with viti help (frontend and UX)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Design for select system page (Laia)
* Redesign sidebar with viti
* Report page: create a pdf of the results. Copy from v2.2 tier A.
* Tier B substages
  - new design

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          tasks not related with viti (backend + frontend link)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[CAN BE DONE]
  * [backend] backend for substages
  * [frontend] Fetching language files asyncronously does not work for offline use (CORS is not compatible with file protocol, find alternative way to loading files offline.)
  * [frontend] variable page / fuel type related constants show in involved inputs table
  * [frontend] redo save button function
  * [frontend] onclose listener: trigger warning if ecam is accidentally closed

[STILL CANNOT BE DONE]: (missing info OR not clear OR not read)
  * [backend] reimplement benchmarks with new v3 backend
  * [backend] Implement changes requested by Corinne on June 19th 2020.
    ``` mail from Corinne:
      Enable to account for different ways of valorising biogas (flare, heat
      and Power for auto-consumption or electricity sales, biomethane injection
      in city grid, or a combination of all in varying %). Enable to enter a
      specific % of leak of CH4 to atmosphere with default value being 2%.

      Enable to account for heat and cold recovery in water supply, sewer
      networks or WWTP. In ECAM, it can just be a value of CO2eq calculated for
      the specific project.

      Enable to enter the following values that add to the total  carbon
      footprint for:
      - Transport of waste products (screenings, grit, grease, sludge, ashesâ€¦)
        Note: one angle of C02 footprint reduction is reducing waste volumes
        and transport distance, but each can make their own calculation for
        that
      - Transport and footprint of purchases (fuel, chemicals, disposable equipment, â€¦)
      - Maintenance staff vehicle fleet.  Note: some utilities change their
        fleet to biofuels to reduce their CO2 footprint
      - Building heating, AC and ventilation as electricity, or fuel, or city
        heat values that compute a CO2eq value. Note: Some utilities might be
        connected to the urban heat grid to support their heating requirements.
        This will remain exceptional, so I would recommend to just have a line
        for people to enter the CO2eq of this heat energy (they will know it
        from the city grid supplier).
      - Miscelleaneous improvements to emissions (i.e.: carbon sequestration of
        the fumes from on-site incinerator) as a negative value to correct
        default calculations in the tool.

      For N2O:
        Enable to account for the N2O emissions using the NTK delta between
        influent and effluent and the IPCC 2019 emissions factor or a country/
        plant  specific emissions factor
        Maintain the possibility to make a correction (as you currently have) for
        those who actually measure their N2O.
        Enable to enter a CO2eq value for assets and their replacement using an
        LCA approach. Point people towards LCA tools to develop it.
        The tool was initially developed to drive carbon emissions reduction in
        emerging countries, not to provide a full footprint. However, developed
        utilities need to report on their full footprint. If we want the tool to
        pick up, it would be great that developed utilities use it for their
        reporting (or integrate the code in their systems ðŸ˜Š). With that in
        mind, and realizing that there is a growing ambition amongst urban water
        operators to transition to carbon neutrality, we need to enable a more
        flexible approach through the above listed points, as the footprint
        reduction can happen on many different fronts.

      I can support the approach on biogas valorisation if you have questions
      on how to calculate.

      Best / Cordialement,
    ```
  * [backend] Enhancement of ghg models (instructions to be received with Maite and Rafa)
  * [frontend] redo load files function ("open" button)
    - implement compabibility module (v2 to v3)
      - ['Yes/No':'Questions']

[WILL BE DONE AT THE END]
  * [frontend] graphs v3 (also Sankey)
  * [frontend] Translations of new pieces of text added for v3
  * [frontend] help/about and docs for v3
