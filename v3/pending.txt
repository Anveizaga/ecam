* Landing Page (TBD with VITI)
  -Design should be improved
  -Links don’t look appealing
  -Should include information about income
  -'Help' button is not easy to find
  -Support docs are missing (esp. Spanish)

* General Info (TBD with VITI)
  -It should be obvious which data is relevant and why (Colours, symbol etc)

* Population (TBD with VITI)
  -Names of input fields could be clearer
  -It’s not clear that the definitions appear if you hover over the fields. A simple (?) could help
  -Definitions should be shorter and more concrete (see FSM, missing definitions)

* Configuration
  -Difference between Tier A and B is not clear
  -They are two different assessments, but it looks like you have to do both + the costs can only be inserted in Tier A. If in ECAM 3.0 both tiers are completely separated, costs should also be inserted in Tier B.

* Tier A:
  -There should be an explanatory sentence on what Tier A (and B), also highlighting the importance of data
  -Results of Tier A are confusing because there are shown as “Outputs” and not as assumed under “Summaries”.
  -Sankey Graphic is not easy to find, it should be under graphics /summary

* Tier B:
  -The tips in the top right corner get lost
  -Advance assessment is easily overseen (+)
  -Advance assessment is not clear. When should this be used and how? For example, it should be used if there are different treatment technologies

* Summaries page:
  -Difference between Tier A and B results should be clearer
  -Units of results could be more obvious
  -Results of sub-stages are only shown when the box is ticked. This is not clear

* Opportunities page:
  -It is not clear how to use it or how results are to be interpreted.
  -Spanish translations are needed
