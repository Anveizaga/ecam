* ECAM V3 CODING TASKS *
------------------------
[GIZ REQUESTS]
  * Priorities
    - IPCC equations compliance
    - Import/Export excel
      - import from excel module with AdriÃ  Riu help. Each layout is a excel file.
      - "https://www.npmjs.com/package/exceljs"
    - User friendliness [VITI]
    - Graphs & report (Energy and GHGs [VITI]
      - Graphs should be downloadable
  * Nice to have:
    - First-Time user tutorial
    - Opportunities page is important, but can come later!

[DOING NOW]
  - [ ] move overview pages to summaries
  - [ ] design minimum required data filter
  - [ ] add a button for -> <button> kgCO2eq/m3 </button> to tier_b.js
    - [ ] abstracted volume  (wsa)
    - [ ] treated volume     (wst)
    - [ ] distributed volume (wsd)
    - [ ] collected volume   (wwc)
    - [ ] treated volume     (wwt)
    - [ ] treated volume     (wwo)
  - [ ] onclose listener: trigger warning if ecam is accidentally closed
  - [ ] trigger error if version does not match when loading json files
  - [ ] new user button overlay (to be filled by viti)
  - [ ] frontend equations.js view (LluÃ­s C.)
  - [ ] sankey diagram export to jpg/png/svg
  - [ ] import layout from excel

[TO BE DONE WHEN V3 IS FEATURE FROZEN]
  - update help & about & docs
  - example v3 json file in docs
  - translations of new pieces of text added for v3
  - external version converter module (v2 to v3)
  - CORS is not compatible with file:// protocol, find alternative way to
    load language json files offline.

[BACKLOG]: (missing info OR not 100% clear how to implement OR help needed from other people)

    ```
      Enable to account for different ways of valorising biogas (flare, heat
      and Power for auto-consumption or electricity sales, biomethane injection
      in city grid, or a combination of all in varying %). Enable to enter a
      specific % of leak of CH4 to atmosphere with default value being 2%.

      Enable to account for heat and cold recovery in water supply, sewer
      networks or WWTP. In ECAM, it can just be a value of CO2eq calculated for
      the specific project.

      Enable to enter the following values that add to the total  carbon
      footprint for:
      - Transport of waste products (screenings, grit, grease, sludge, ashesâ€¦)
        Note: one angle of C02 footprint reduction is reducing waste volumes
        and transport distance, but each can make their own calculation for
        that
      - Transport and footprint of purchases (fuel, chemicals, disposable equipment, â€¦)
      - Maintenance staff vehicle fleet.  Note: some utilities change their
        fleet to biofuels to reduce their CO2 footprint
      - Building heating, AC and ventilation as electricity, or fuel, or city
        heat values that compute a CO2eq value. Note: Some utilities might be
        connected to the urban heat grid to support their heating requirements.
        This will remain exceptional, so I would recommend to just have a line
        for people to enter the CO2eq of this heat energy (they will know it
        from the city grid supplier).
      - Miscelleaneous improvements to emissions (i.e.: carbon sequestration of
        the fumes from on-site incinerator) as a negative value to correct
        default calculations in the tool.

      For N2O:
        Enable to account for the N2O emissions using the NTK delta between
        influent and effluent and the IPCC 2019 emissions factor or a country/
        plant  specific emissions factor
        Maintain the possibility to make a correction (as you currently have) for
        those who actually measure their N2O.
        Enable to enter a CO2eq value for assets and their replacement using an
        LCA approach. Point people towards LCA tools to develop it.
        The tool was initially developed to drive carbon emissions reduction in
        emerging countries, not to provide a full footprint. However, developed
        utilities need to report on their full footprint. If we want the tool to
        pick up, it would be great that developed utilities use it for their
        reporting (or integrate the code in their systems ðŸ˜Š). With that in
        mind, and realizing that there is a growing ambition amongst urban water
        operators to transition to carbon neutrality, we need to enable a more
        flexible approach through the above listed points, as the footprint
        reduction can happen on many different fronts.

      I can support the approach on biogas valorisation if you have questions
      on how to calculate.

      Best / Cordialement,
