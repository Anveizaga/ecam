* ECAM V3 CODING TASKS *
------------------------
* Priorities
  - Graphs & report (Energy and GHGs [VITI])
  - IPCC equations compliance

[DOING NOW - concrete tasks - BUGS HAVE HIGHEST PRIORITY ALWAYS]
  - BUG: solve all Global calls
    - conv_kwh_co2
    - bod_pday
    - etc

  - BUG: in variable.js: outputs that use this variable / drop-down selection
    (exceptions) value showed: now we see the Exceptions[key] object as a
    string instead of the input value

  - TASK: finish report.js

  - TASK: finish compare_scenarios.js

  - TASK: UNFCC categories convert to new v3 equation structure
    - link for v2 version --> http://wacclim.org/ecam/edit.php?level=UNFCCC

  - REQ: create minimum required data filter
    - input required

  - REQ: add a button for -> <button> kgCO2eq/m3 </button> to tier_b.js
    - abstracted volume  (wsa)
    - treated volume     (wst)
    - distributed volume (wsd)
    - collected volume   (wwc)
    - treated volume     (wwt)
    - treated volume     (wwo)

  - ENH: onclose listener: trigger warning if ecam is accidentally closed

  - ENH: check if version does not match when loading json files

  - NEW: create References structure for documentation.

[TO BE DONE WHEN V3 IS FEATURE FROZEN]
  - update help & about & docs
  - example v3 json file in docs
  - translations of new pieces of text added for v3
    - create automated tag finder
    - main task for Roser (February 1st 2021)
  - external version converter module (v2 to v3)
  - CORS is not compatible with file:// protocol, find alternative way to
    load language json files offline.

[BACKLOG]: (missing info OR not 100% clear how to implement OR help needed from
other people)

    ```
      Enable to account for different ways of valorising biogas in a
      combination of all in varying %:
        - Flared.
        - Heat and power for auto-consumption or electricity sales.
        - Biomethane injection in city grid.
        - Leak with default value being 2%.
        - Other.

      Enable to account for heat and cold recovery in water supply, sewer
      networks or WWTP. It can just be a value of CO2eq calculated for
      the specific project.

      Enable to enter the following values that add to the total carbon
      footprint for:
        - Transport of waste products (screenings, grit, grease, sludge,
          ashes...) Note: one angle of C02 footprint reduction is reducing
          waste volumes and transport distance, but each can make their own
          calculation for that
        - Transport and footprint of purchases (fuel, chemicals, disposable
          equipment..)
        - Maintenance staff vehicle fleet.  Note: some utilities change their
          fleet to biofuels to reduce their CO2 footprint
        - Building heating, AC and ventilation as electricity, or fuel, or city
          heat values that compute a CO2eq value. Note: Some utilities might be
          connected to the urban heat grid to support their heating
          requirements.  This will remain exceptional, so I would recommend to
          just have a line for people to enter the CO2eq of this heat energy
          (they will know it from the city grid supplier).
        - Miscelleaneous improvements to emissions (i.e.: carbon sequestration
          of the fumes from on-site incinerator) as a negative value to correct
          default calculations in the tool.

      For N2O:
        Enable to account for the N2O emissions using the NTK delta between
        influent and effluent and the IPCC 2019 emissions factor or a country/
        plant  specific emissions factor
        Maintain the possibility to make a correction (as you currently have) for
        those who actually measure their N2O.
        Enable to enter a CO2eq value for assets and their replacement using an
        LCA approach. Point people towards LCA tools to develop it.
        The tool was initially developed to drive carbon emissions reduction in
        emerging countries, not to provide a full footprint. However, developed
        utilities need to report on their full footprint. If we want the tool to
        pick up, it would be great that developed utilities use it for their
        reporting (or integrate the code in their systems ðŸ˜Š). With that in
        mind, and realizing that there is a growing ambition amongst urban water
        operators to transition to carbon neutrality, we need to enable a more
        flexible approach through the above listed points, as the footprint
        reduction can happen on many different fronts.

      I can support the approach on biogas valorisation if you have questions
      on how to calculate.

      Best / Cordialement,

[FUTURE - v3.1]
  - Chemicals
  - Optgroups in <select> elements
  - Feedback button
  - First-Time user tutorial
  - Import/Export excel
    - export can be the same as v2
    - import module with AdriÃ  Riu help. Each assessment is an excel file.
      - task for Roser: generator of the template for importing.
    - "https://www.npmjs.com/package/exceljs"
  - Execute backend from CLI without web frontend.
  - Opportunities page (TBD)
    - execute multiple simulations variating parameters and do sensitivity analysis
  - Load JSON file from URL
    - ecam opens a link to a server and retreieves a json string that is
      converted to a ecam json file.
