ECAM CODING TASKS - tasks also in https://github.com/icra/ecam/issues
=====================================================================
* task:
  transfer all items in this file to github.com/icra/ecam/issues

* PRIORITIES v3
  - Graphs & report
  - IPCC compliance

* DOING NOW - concrete and well defined tasks only - BUGS HAVE HIGHEST PRIORITY ALWAYS
  - check that every emission is in:
    - sankey
    - unfccc
  - adapt biogas equations for onsite treatment too
  - trigger warning when checking version when loading json files
  - fill References structure for documentation ("backend/references.js")

* TO BE DONE WHEN V3 IS FEATURE FROZEN
  - update help & about & docs & example json file
  - external version converter module (v2 to v3)
  - [offline] CORS is not compatible with the "file://" protocol, find alternative way to
    load language json files when using ecam offline.

* BACKLOG: NEW FUNCTIONALITIES FOR NEXT VERSION
  - Possibility to choose IPCC approach or BEAM
  - Chemicals
  - Optgroups in <select> elements
  - First-Time user tutorial
  - Execute backend from CLI without web frontend.
  - Opportunities page (TBD)
    - execute multiple simulations variating parameters and do sensitivity analysis
  - Load JSON file from URL
    - open a link to retreieve a json string that is converted to a ecam json
      file, via XMLHttpRequest.

      Enable to account for heat and cold recovery in water supply, sewer
      networks or WWTP. It can just be a value of CO2eq calculated for
      the specific project.

      Enable to enter the following values that add to the total carbon
      footprint for:
        - Transport of waste products (screenings, grit, grease, sludge,
          ashes...) Note: one angle of C02 footprint reduction is reducing
          waste volumes and transport distance, but each can make their own
          calculation for that
        - Transport and footprint of purchases (fuel, chemicals, disposable
          equipment..)
        - Maintenance staff vehicle fleet.  Note: some utilities change their
          fleet to biofuels to reduce their CO2 footprint
        - Building heating, AC and ventilation as electricity, or fuel, or city
          heat values that compute a CO2eq value. Note: Some utilities might be
          connected to the urban heat grid to support their heating
          requirements.  This will remain exceptional, so I would recommend to
          just have a line for people to enter the CO2eq of this heat energy
          (they will know it from the city grid supplier).
        - Miscelleaneous improvements to emissions (i.e.: carbon sequestration
          of the fumes from on-site incinerator) as a negative value to correct
          default calculations in the tool.

      For N2O:
        - Enable to account for the N2O emissions using the NTK delta between
          influent and effluent and the IPCC 2019 emissions factor or a
          country/ plant  specific emissions factor.
        - Maintain the possibility to make a correction (as you currently have)
          for those who actually measure their N2O.
        - Enable to enter a CO2eq value for assets and their replacement using
          an LCA approach. Point people towards LCA tools to develop it.

        I can support the approach on biogas valorisation if you have questions
        on how to calculate.

      I was taking some notes as I was going through the exercise and the entry of
      data of the Grenoble WWTP I have. I include some of the below in the survey
      monkey, but not all. So just forwarding to you

      COLLECTION STAGE N2O EMISSION FACTOR (UNTREATED COLLECTED WASTEWATER)
        The options are not the same as for CH4 even though it is the same WW being
        discharged…-> confusing for user -> I know it is like this in IPCC but it needs
        to be explained.

      CH4 EMISSION FACTOR (TREATMENT)
        The treatment options are overlapping: when would someone choose “Activated
        sludge”  which is one type of aerobic treatment? The IPCC table p6.20 is
        shorter than your list -> I recommend using the IPCC list to avoid confusion OR
        explain when to choose the activated sludge treatment categories.

      TOTAL NITROGEN LOAD IN THE EFFLUENT
        The default value proposed for the situation I tested (a primary+ secondary
        treatment only) seems off. It assumes a 40% removal of N whereas secondary
        plants can have a 60 to 70% removal depending on the load and temperatures… In
        France most plant have a low loading rate with no tertiary treatment and remove
        60 to 80% of N that way. It would be good to make the correction or clarify
        “high-rate secondary biological treatment” rather than “primary + secondary”


      BIOGAS PRODUCED
        The unit is in kg whereas biogas is measured in Nm3
        It seems there is no benefit to the GHG assessment to valorise biogas, when you
        don’t reduce the grid electricity purchase.
        It doesn’t provide an option for “emissions avoided for selling biogas” which
        could be similar to the section “emissions avoided for ruse of nutrients”

      REPORT
        The report is only available in total kg during the assessment period. It would
        be useful to be able to choose the unit, like under the inventory (kg/year or
        kg/year/serviced pop)

      In the exercise file, the WW collected and discharged untreated is not accounted for. Was this intentional?
